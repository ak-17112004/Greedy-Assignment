Geekina got stuck on an island. There is only one shop on this island and it is open on all days of the week except for Sunday. Consider following constraints:
-> N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
-> S – Number of days you are required to survive.
-> M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Currently, it’s Monday, and she needs to survive for the next S days.
Find the minimum number of days on which you need to buy food from the shop so that she can survive the next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive.
CODE:
import math
def can_survive(N, S, M):
    total_food_required = S * M
    
    buying_days = S - (S // 7)
    
    if M > N or total_food_required > buying_days * N:
        return "No, survival is not possible."
    
    min_days = math.ceil(total_food_required / N)
    
    return f"Yes, survival is possible. Minimum days to buy food: {min_days}"

N = 16  
S = 10 
M = 2 

print(can_survive(N, S, M))
