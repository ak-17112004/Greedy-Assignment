There are given N ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths.
The task is to connect the ropes with minimum cost. Given N size array arr[] contains the lengths of the ropes.
CODE:
import heapq

class Solution:
    def minCost(self,arr,n) :
            
        heapq.heapify(arr)
        ans=0
        while len(arr)>1:
            
            a = heapq.heappop(arr)
            b = heapq.heappop(arr)
            
            c = a+b
            
            ans+=c
            
            heapq.heappush(arr,c)

        return ans
