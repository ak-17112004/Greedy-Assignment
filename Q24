There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number 1, 0, or -1 written on it.
You are given four non-negative integers numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes, and k.
The bag initially contains:
numOnes items with 1s written on them.
numZeroes items with 0s written on them.
numNegOnes items with -1s written on them.
We want to pick exactly k items among the available items. Return the maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def kItemsWithMaximumSum(self, numOnes: int, numZeros: int, numNegOnes: int, k: int) -> int:
        if numOnes > k:
            return k
        rem = k - numOnes - numZeros
        if rem <= 0:
            return numOnes
        return numOnes - rem
