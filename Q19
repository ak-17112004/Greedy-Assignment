We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits.
CODE:

def findPlatform(arr, dep, n):
    plat_needed = 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # minimum platform needed
        plat_needed = 1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                if (arr[i] >= arr[j] and dep[j] >= arr[i]):
                    plat_needed += 1
        result = max(result, plat_needed)
    return result
def main():
    arr = [100, 300, 500]
    dep = [900, 400, 600]
    n = len(arr)
    print("{}".format(
        findPlatform(arr, dep, n)))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
