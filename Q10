There is one meeting room in a firm. There are n meetings in the form of (start[i], end[i]) where start[i] is start time of meeting i and end[i] is finish time of meeting i.
What is the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room when only one meeting can be held in the meeting room at a particular time?
Return the maximum number of meetings that can be held in the meeting room.
CODE:
class Solution 
{
   
    public static int maxMeetings(int start[], int end[], int n)
    {
      PriorityQueue<Node> pq=new PriorityQueue<Node>((a,b)->a.end-b.end);
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
          pq.add(new Node(start[i],end[i]));
      }
      int count=1;
      int prev=pq.poll().end;
      while(pq.size()>0){
          Node curr=pq.poll();
      
          if(curr.start>prev){
              count++;
              prev=curr.end;
          }
          
      }
      return count;
    }
    static class Node{
        int start;
        int end;
        Node(int start,int end){
            this.start=start;
            this.end=end;
        }
    }
